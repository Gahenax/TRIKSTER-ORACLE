# JULES CALIBRATION REPORT

**Target Agent**: Jules (Phase 1: Monte Carlo)  
**Calibrator**: Antigravity (Spectral Chaos Engine)  
**Date**: 2026-02-15  

## 📊 Spectral Baseline
After integrating the `spectral.py` module into Jules's core engine, we performed a baseline calibration:

- **Metric**: r-mean (Ratio of adjacent interval spacings)
- **Engine Version**: v2.0.1 (Maturation Branch)
- **N Sims**: 5000
- **Status**: **POISSON_ORDERED**
- **r-mean Value**: **0.3871**

## 🏁 Calibration Verdict: SUCCESS
Jules is now **calibrated** with the same high-precision spectral technology used in our Riemann research. This allows the Trickster Oracle to:

1.  **Monitor Entropy**: Detect if simulations are becoming too rigid or too chaotic.
2.  **Audit Fidelity**: Ensure that "randomness" in forecasts follows expected statistical signatures.
3.  **Future-Proofing**: Ready to implement GUE-hardened simulations if the market hypothesis shifts to a chaotic regime.

**Action for Jules**:
Jules must ensure that all future commits to `backend/app/core/engine.py` include the spectral report in the `DistributionObject` notes.
