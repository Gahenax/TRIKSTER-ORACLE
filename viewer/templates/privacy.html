<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
<p>Trickster Companion is designed with a <strong>privacy-first, stateless architecture</strong>. When you upload or
    paste a report.json file, the data is processed in-memory to render your view and is not stored in our databases by
    default.</p>

<h2>2. Cookies and Advertising</h2>
<p>We use Google AdSense to serve ads on this website. Google may use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to
    this or other websites. You may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a
        href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" style="color:var(--primary)">Ads Settings</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Our desktop core application remains ad-free and offline-first. This web viewer is a separate companion service
    intended for report visualization only.</p>
