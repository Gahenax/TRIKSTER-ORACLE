# TRICKSTER-ORACLE — Public Positioning

## Core Message (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Trickster-Oracle does not predict outcomes.
It simulates scenarios and quantifies uncertainty.

## What It Does
- Runs Monte Carlo simulations over real events
- Shows full probability distributions, not single numbers
- Exposes volatility, data quality and time decay
- Uses tokens to unlock analytical depth, not promises

## What It Explicitly Does NOT Do
- No guaranteed results
- No "safe picks"
- No betting optimization

## Audience
- Technical and analytical users
- Curious minds uncomfortable with false certainty
- People who want to understand risk, not outsource decisions

## Ethical Note
The free tier is always available.
Tokens unlock depth of analysis, never certainty.
