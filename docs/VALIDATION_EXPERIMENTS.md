# TRICKSTER-ORACLE v2 — Validation Experiments (2 Weeks)

## Objective
Measure real analytical interest, not hype.

## Test Group
- 10–20 users max
- Profiles: devs, data analysts, traders, probabilistic thinkers
- No influencers, no mass traffic

## Setup
- Each user receives 100 free tokens
- No instructions beyond basic usage
- Observe behavior, do not guide decisions

## Metrics (ONLY THESE)
1. % users leaving free tier
2. Tokens spent per user
3. Time per session
4. Return rate (48–72h)
5. Repeated 402 errors per user

## Interpretation Rules
- Low token spend ≠ pricing issue
- Low token spend = framing or UX issue
- If users don’t spend free tokens, they won’t buy them

## Success Signal
Users voluntarily spend tokens to explore uncertainty,
not because they expect outcomes.
