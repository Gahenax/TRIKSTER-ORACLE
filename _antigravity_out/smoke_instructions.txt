Smoke Test Procedure (Web Viewer)

Prereqs:
- Have at least one exported report file in REPORTS_DIR named <report_id>.json
- Each report must match ReportEnvelope schema and include signature_sha256 of payload

1) Install (dev)
   pip install -e viewer[dev]

2) Run tests
   pytest -q viewer/tests

3) Start server
   set VIEWER_API_KEY=
   set REPORTS_DIR=./exports
   python -m uvicorn viewer.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

4) Verify health
   curl http://localhost:8080/health

5) List reports
   curl http://localhost:8080/reports?limit=50&offset=0

6) Get report (verifies signature)
   curl http://localhost:8080/reports/<report_id>

7) Verify endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8080/reports/<report_id>/verify

Release Gate:
- Viewer tests pass
- Signature mismatch is rejected (400)
- POST/PUT/DELETE are blocked (405)
- health + list + get + verify succeed on sample exports
